{"extracted_information": "The article details the record-breaking $8 million NIL deal for quarterback Darian Mensah upon his transfer commitment to Duke University. The deal, reported by CBS Sports on December 23, 2024, is for two years with an average annual value of $4 million. This valuation positions Mensah, a transfer from Tulane and ranked as the No. 7 quarterback in the transfer portal by 247Sports, as the unofficial highest-paid player in college football history. The deal highlights the rapid growth and increasing price tags in the college recruiting market under NIL rules. His compensation is noted as being more than double the deals received by top transfer quarterbacks Cam Ward and Riley Leonard the previous year. The market trend is further exemplified by the reported $7 million NIL deal for one year for No. 1 men's basketball recruit AJ Dybansta with BYU. The article suggests that rising deals are likely to continue, particularly with the potential final approval of the House v. NCAA settlement in April, which could allow schools to share revenue with players and pay significant amounts (up to around $22 million) to athletes annually starting the following year.", "specifications": {}, "pricing": {"total_value": "$8 million", "duration": "2 years", "average_annual_value": "$4 million"}, "features": [], "statistics": {}, "temporal_info": {"commitment_date": "December 11, 2024", "deal_reported_date": "December 23, 2024", "article_publication_date": "December 26, 2024", "house_ncaa_settlement_expected_approval": "April [following publication]"}, "geographical_data": {"player_origin_transfer": "Tulane", "new_school": "Duke University"}, "references": ["CBS Sports", "247Sports (No. 7 quarterback in the transfer portal)", "247Sports (No. 1 ranked transfer quarterback John Mateer)", "frontofficesports.com (AJ Dybansta deal)"]}
